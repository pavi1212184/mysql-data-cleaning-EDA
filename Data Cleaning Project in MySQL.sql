-- 2. Standardizing Data

SELECT * 
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2;


SELECT DISTINCT industry
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
ORDER BY industry;

SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
WHERE industry IS NULL 
OR industry = ''
ORDER BY industry;


SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
WHERE company LIKE 'Bally%';

SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
WHERE company LIKE 'airbnb%';


-- setting the blanks to nulls 
UPDATE world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
SET industry = NULL
WHERE industry = '';

-- Checking all nulls

SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
WHERE industry IS NULL 
OR industry = ''
ORDER BY industry;

-- now we need to populate those nulls if possible

UPDATE layoffs_staging2 t1
JOIN layoffs_staging2 t2
ON t1.company = t2.company
SET t1.industry = t2.industry
WHERE t1.industry IS NULL
AND t2.industry IS NOT NULL;

-- if we check it looks like Bally's was the only one without a populated row to populate this null values
SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
WHERE industry IS NULL 
OR industry = ''
ORDER BY industry;


-- Crypto has multiple different variations. Need to standardize that 
SELECT DISTINCT industry
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
ORDER BY industry;

UPDATE layoffs_staging2
SET industry = 'Crypto'
WHERE industry IN ('Crypto Currency', 'CryptoCurrency');

--

SELECT DISTINCT industry
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
ORDER BY industry;

--

SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2;

-- Standardising "United States" and "United States."
SELECT DISTINCT country
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
ORDER BY country;

UPDATE layoffs_staging2
SET country = TRIM(TRAILING '.' FROM country);

-- Fixed it
SELECT DISTINCT country
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
ORDER BY country;


-- Fixing the date columns:
SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2;

-- using str to date to update this field
UPDATE layoffs_staging2
SET `date` = STR_TO_DATE(`date`, '%m/%d/%Y');

-- converting the data type properly
ALTER TABLE layoffs_staging2
MODIFY COLUMN `date` DATE;


SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2;


-- 3. Fixing Null Values
-- Leaving them as null as it makes it easier for calculations
-- Nothing to change with the null values 


-- 4. Removing unnecessary columns and rows 

SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
WHERE total_laid_off IS NULL;


SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
WHERE total_laid_off IS NULL
AND percentage_laid_off IS NULL;

-- Delete Useless data we can't really use

DELETE FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
WHERE total_laid_off IS NULL
AND percentage_laid_off IS NULL;

SELECT * 
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2;

ALTER TABLE layoffs_staging2
DROP COLUMN row_num;


SELECT * 
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2;
